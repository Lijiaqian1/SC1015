## Doctor's assistance webapp
Doctor's assistance webapp uses the model we have trained and turn it into a webapp intented for doctor to use in conjunction with their own diagnosis.
The webapp will tell the doctor it's prediction and how confident it is. The doctor then may use this for their consideration.
